My Task Manager 

Hey! This is my To-Do List web app designed to help you manage daily tasks easily. It’s simple, interactive, and visually appealing, with cool animations and a soft pink theme that’s easy on the eyes.

What it does

Add tasks with a priority (High / Medium / Low).

Edit tasks anytime.

Mark tasks complete or pending – click the check icon to toggle.

Delete tasks you no longer need.

Track your progress – see total tasks, completed tasks, and a neat animated progress bar.

Filter tasks – view All, Completed, or Pending tasks.

Persistent data – tasks are saved in your browser using local storage, so refreshing the page won’t lose them.

Fun bonus – a Chuck Norris joke is displayed every time you open the app to keep things fun!

How it looks

Soft white + pink background with a slight blur overlay.

Glassmorphism style cards for tasks.

Animated entries when a task is added.

Celebration animation when a task is marked complete.

Hover effects on buttons for a smooth interactive feel.

Fully responsive, works well on desktop and mobile.

How to use it

Clone this repo or download the files.

Open the folder and double-click index.html in your browser.

Start adding tasks, edit, mark as complete, or delete.

Watch the progress bar fill up as you complete tasks!

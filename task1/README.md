Task 1 – Student Attendance Management System


## Problem Statement
To develop a system that:
- Maintains student entry order
- Allows fast attendance verification
- Supports undoing the last attendance entry
- Displays all present students in order of arrival
## Data Structures Used
- Queue – to maintain student entry order
- Stack – to undo the last marked attendance
- Hash Set – for quick presence checking
- Vector/List – to display attendance records
## Files Included
- `attendance.cpp` – C++ implementation of the attendance management system
## Learning Outcome
Through this task, fundamental concepts of data structures, STL usage, and problem-solving in C++ were applied and reinforced.
